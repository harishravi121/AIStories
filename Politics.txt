The year was 2004. Harish, a young man with fire in his eyes and a worn Voter ID card clutched in his calloused hand, stood amidst the clamor of campaigning chaos. He wasn't born into any political dynasty, he wasn't backed by wealth or power. His weapon? His voice, resonating with the unspoken frustrations of his village.

Harish had witnessed enough. Broken roads, crumbling schools, and apathetic leaders who treated their positions like inherited jewels. He knew something had to change, and the key, he believed, lay in that small blue card in his hand.

His campaign was guerrilla. He painted his message on walls, wrote it on his shirt, and sang it in folk songs that pulsed through the dusty lanes. He spoke of clean water, accessible healthcare, and education that wouldn't just be a privilege. He promised not just change, but a hand in crafting it.

His opponent, a seasoned politician, scoffed at first. But Harish's sincerity and the village's pent-up yearning proved a potent force. On election day, the impossible happened. Harish, the village nobody, became the panchayat leader.

The next twenty years were a whirlwind. Each victory, a rung higher on the ladder. He became sarpanch, then MLA, then MP, his name now spoken not just in dusty villages but in the hallowed halls of Parliament. His face, once weathered by sun and doubt, now graced national newspapers, etched with the determination of a man who'd climbed a mountain with only his will as a pickaxe.

But in another universe, a parallel reality spun a different tale. In this universe, Harish's voice found no fertile ground in the village politics. His opponent, a master of dirty tricks, stole the election. Disheartened, Harish left, seeking solace in the anonymity of the city.

He found work as a teacher, his passion for change now channeled into shaping young minds. He taught them not just facts, but the power of their own voices. He instilled in them the belief that even a single pebble could create ripples in the stagnant waters of apathy.

And the ripples they made were tidal. His students, inspired by his example, became torchbearers. They joined movements, contested elections, and slowly, subtly, the landscape of politics began to shift.

Years later, the Prime Minister, an autocratic figure who'd ruled with an iron fist, faced his biggest challenge â€“ a wave of youth-led protests demanding change. It was amidst this turmoil that Harish's former students, now seasoned politicians themselves, rose to prominence.

Their voices, echoing Harish's forgotten dream, resonated with millions. The country held its breath as the elections approached. And when the results poured in, the impossible happened again. The students, united by Harish's spirit, dethroned the old guard.

In this universe, Harish never wore the Prime Minister's mantle. Yet, his legacy lived on, not in the marble halls of power, but in the countless young voices raised in dissent, in the quiet classrooms nurturing future leaders, and in the unyielding spirit of a man who dared to dream, even when the world told him to be silent.

Both universes, two sides of the same coin, whispered different versions of Harish's story. A testament to the fact that the fire of change can light a path not just to individual glory, but to the collective transformation of a nation. The true mark of a leader, after all, lies not in the titles they wear, but in the ripples they set in motion, long after their own voice fades away.

In one of the million parellel universes I could have become a prime minister but a professor seems easier.
