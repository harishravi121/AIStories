Harish's daily commute to the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) was no small feat. From his cozy corner in Bengaluru, nestled amidst the bustling streets, he embarked on a 20-kilometre journey, twice a day, five days a week. This wasn't just any ordinary commute; it was a tapestry woven with the vibrant threads of public transport, bustling with life and unexpected adventures.

The journey began at the crack of dawn, with the first streaks of sunlight painting the sky. Buses, his preferred mode of transport, pulsed with the rhythm of the city. He'd weave through throngs of passengers, a seasoned navigator in this human sea. The cacophony of conversations, the rhythmic hum of the engine, and the occasional honk became his soundtrack, a symphony of the everyday.

But Harish wasn't one to be swayed by the monotony. He found pockets of joy in the mundane. His phone, a portal to a world of possibilities, kept him company. He'd lose himself in the fantastical landscapes of video games, each tap and swipe a brushstroke painting an escape from reality. Sometimes, he'd become a silent observer, his phone lens capturing the fleeting moments of human drama unfolding around him - a child's infectious laughter, an old couple holding hands, a street vendor's weathered smile.

Music was his other muse. Earbuds plugged in, he'd let the melodies wash over him, a kaleidoscope of sounds transporting him to different worlds. Sometimes, he'd tap his foot to the beat, a silent symphony playing inside his head. Other times, he'd close his eyes and let the music paint pictures in his mind, each note a brushstroke on the canvas of his imagination.

And then there was the work itself. IISc, a sprawling haven of knowledge, buzzed with intellectual energy. Harish, a research scholar in the field of astrophysics, thrived in this atmosphere. He'd spend his days delving into the mysteries of the universe, grappling with complex equations, and chasing elusive data. The long commute, instead of draining him, fueled his focus. The constant hum of the city, the fleeting glimpses of human stories, served as a reminder of the vastness of existence, the very subject of his research.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in fiery hues, Harish would make his way back home. The return journey was a mirror image of the morning, yet different. Each day brought new encounters, new stories, new melodies to his commute. He'd return home, not just physically, but also emotionally and intellectually richer, his mind brimming with ideas, his heart brimming with experiences.

Harish's story is a testament to the human spirit's ability to find joy and purpose in the most unexpected places. His 20-kilometre commute wasn't just a means to an end; it was an adventure, a canvas for creativity, and a testament to the power of finding beauty in the everyday. He wasn't just a commuter; he was a storyteller, a musician, a photographer, and above all, a scientist chasing the stars, one bus ride at a time.
